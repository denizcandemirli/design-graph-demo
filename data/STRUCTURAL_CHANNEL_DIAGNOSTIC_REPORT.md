## 2. Structural Similarity Differentiation

### Channel Statistics (Off-Diagonal)

| Channel | Mean | Min | Max | Std |
|---------|------|-----|-----|-----|
| S1 (Adjacency) | 0.9583 | 0.8400 | 1.0000 | 0.0469 |
| S2 (Motif) | 0.9202 | 0.6128 | 1.0000 | 0.0985 |
| S3 (System) | 0.9710 | 0.8734 | 1.0000 | 0.0331 |
| S4 (Functional) | 0.8000 | 0.0000 | 1.0000 | 0.4000 |
| **S_struct (Fused)** | **0.9456** | **0.7458** | **1.0000** | **0.0636** |

### Channel Dominance
- **S3 (System) channel dominates** structural similarity computation

## 3. Limitations & Data Quality

1. 1 models lack explicit functional roles, making S4 similarity less meaningful

---

## 4. Scientific Explanation for S4 Behavior


**S4 (Functional Roles) Analysis:**

1. **Role Distribution**:
   - Models with functional roles: 9/10
   - Models without functional roles: 1/10
   - Role types present: Only LoadBearing (LB) detected; Shear, Moment, Bracing are all zero

2. **S4 Similarity Clustering**:
   - Models with LB roles show S4≈1.0 with each other (similar role profiles)
   - Models without roles show S4=0.0 with models that have roles (orthogonal vectors)
   - This creates a **bimodal distribution** in S4 similarity

3. **Why S4 Mean is 0.8000**:
   - The mean is pulled up by the large cluster of models with similar LB profiles (S4≈1.0)
   - The mean is pulled down by comparisons between role-having and role-lacking models (S4=0.0)
   - This reflects **data quality limitations**, not computational issues

4. **Scientific Interpretation**:
   - S4 is **functionally meaningful** for models within the same cluster
   - S4 **cannot differentiate** models that both lack roles (all zero vectors)
   - S4 **correctly identifies** models with different role profiles (high vs. zero roles)
   - The absence of Shear, Moment, Bracing roles is a **data limitation**, not a method limitation

**Conclusion**: S4 behavior is **scientifically correct** but **limited by data quality**. The channel works as designed but would benefit from richer functional role annotations in the RDF models.

## 5. Specific Model Pair Analysis

### Key Model Pair Analysis (ALL10 Dataset)

**Building_05_DG ↔ Building_06_DG:**
- S1 (Adjacency): 0.9808
- S2 (Motif): 0.9978
- S3 (System): 0.9988
- S4 (Functional): 1.0000
- **S_struct (Fused)**: **0.9983**

**Building_05_DG ↔ DFAB_Analog_Building07:**
- S1 (Adjacency): 0.9957
- S2 (Motif): 0.9478
- S3 (System): 0.9814
- S4 (Functional): 1.0000
- **S_struct (Fused)**: **0.9646**

**Building_06_DG ↔ DFAB_Analog_Building07:**
- S1 (Adjacency): 0.9946
- S2 (Motif): 0.9668
- S3 (System): 0.9897
- S4 (Functional): 1.0000
- **S_struct (Fused)**: **0.9783**

**Interpretation:**
- B05 and B06 are **highly similar** structurally (S_struct > 0.99), indicating they share similar structural systems
- S3 (System) channel dominates the similarity computation, indicating system-level alignment
- S4 (Functional) shows identical profiles (S4=1.0) for models with LoadBearing roles, confirming shared functional role distributions
- The ALL10 dataset shows consistent structural patterns across models

## 6. Future Improvements

1. Proxy-based motif detection used in 40 cases. Consider improving structural topology enrichment for more accurate motif extraction

### General Recommendations:


1. **Enrichment Pipeline**: Add functional role extraction from IFC properties during RDF conversion
2. **Motif Detection**: Improve structural topology enrichment to reduce proxy-based motif detection
3. **Validation**: Cross-validate structural similarity with domain expert assessments
4. **Scalability**: Test on larger datasets to assess generalization
